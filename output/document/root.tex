\title{Transitive Closure Implementation with Meta data}
\author{Nils Cremer}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
In this work we provide algorithms to calculate the transitive closure of a relation.
In addition to the transitive closure the algirhtms also provides meta data for each element such as corresponsing proof term.
We prove correctness of the algorithms in the sense that the transitive closure is produced and that the meta data are valid with respect to a user specified predicate.
